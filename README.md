Serverless Plugin Boilerplate
=============================

This is a starter project to help you build plugins for the Serverless Framework.

You can install this Plugin in its current form into your Serverless Projects and it will run.  All that's left for you to do is write your custom logic.  We've also filled this with useful comments to help you along your way.

The entire Serverless Framework is comprised of Plugins.  When you write your own Plugin, it's no hack, you're simply extending and customizing the Serverless Framework to suite your needs and build processes.

**A Serverless Plugin can do the following:**

* Add a Custom Action to the Serverless Framework which can be called via the command line, programatically via a handler, or both.
* Add a Custom Action that overwrites a Core Action in the Serverless Framework.
* Add a Custom Hook that fires *before* or *after* a Core Action or a Custom Action.

One plugin can do all of the above, and include several Hooks and Actions at once.
